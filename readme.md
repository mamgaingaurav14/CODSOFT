# 🎓 CODSOFT Internship Projects – Machine Learning 💻

Welcome to my collection of ML mini-projects completed as part of the **CODSOFT Machine Learning Internship**!  
This repository includes 3 complete machine learning pipelines built using Python and Scikit-learn, with hands-on experience across text classification, customer analytics, and predictive modeling.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1. [Spam SMS Detection](./SPAM SMS DETECTION)
A binary classification task to predict whether a message is spam or ham (not spam) using text preprocessing and **Naive Bayes**.

### 2. [Movie Genre Classification](./MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION)
Predicts movie genre based on its plot using **TF-IDF Vectorizer** and **Logistic Regression**.

### 3. [Customer Churn Prediction](./CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION)
Predicts whether a customer will leave a service using tabular customer data and **Logistic Regression**.

## 🚀 How to Run These Projects

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CODSOFT.git
   cd CODSOFT
   ```

2. **Navigate to a project folder** (e.g., Spam SMS):
   ```bash
   cd SPAM-SMS-DETECTION
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (recommended in a virtual environment):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the `.ipynb` file and run each cell in order to see the output.

## 🧠 What I Learned (or Unlearned 😄)

As part of the **CODSOFT Internship**, I got exposure to applying ML models in the real world. These were beginner-friendly but still challenged me with:
- Text data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Encoding and vectorization
- Realizing how easy it is to overfit 😅
- The importance of confusion matrix in life decisions (and models)

Even though some tasks felt silly at first ("how hard can predicting spam be?"), I ended up learning a lot — especially the kind of small stuff that tutorials often skip.

## 🙌 About the CODSOFT Internship

CODSOFT is a platform that provides short-term technical internships for students to build real-world skills through guided projects.  
In this internship, I was given 3–5 projects to complete independently with creative freedom and basic problem statements.

And yes, I now have 3 full ML projects under my belt — thanks CODSOFT! 🚀
